Exercice 1: Jewib 3al as2la:
How many X do we have?
do we have duplicates?
do we have missing data?
do we have misclassified data?
what is the y value for the X column?
Exercice 2: Jewib 3al as2la 2:
What are the 4 Xest values of Y column? (sorting)
what is the X thing for the Y column grouped by Z? (single grouping)
what is the X thing for the Y column grouped by Z then E? (multi grouping)
what are the [] things for Y column (aggregation)
Exercice 3: plots
does X influence Y?
does X change au cours du temps?
Is X uniformally distributed?
Does X have outliers?
Can you show me the distribution of the values of X?
Exercice 3: do the necessary changes so that the code works
assert df.isna().sum().sum() == 0
assert df.duplicates() == 0
assert df[[cols]].dtypes == [types]
Exercice 4.1: which is best ML (regression)
what was the best RMSE?
what preprocessing steps did you take?
Exercice 4.2: which is best ML
what ml model gave best results?
what was the f1 & precision?
Exercice 4.3: which is best parameters
What were the preprocessing steps you took?
what ml model gave best results?
where its hyperparameters?
what was the f1 & Precision?
Exercice 4.4: with constraints
same as above
constraint: less than XMo but no less than Y f1
Exercice 5:
